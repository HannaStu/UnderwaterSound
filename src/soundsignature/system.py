        This class contains information about the system utilised for recording
        underwater noise. A station may have several recording systems (a recorder/hydrophone
        pair with respective parameters gain, sensitivity and depth), which record several audio
        data (name, initial recording time, if annotated, labels, and any comments).

        The required information of a system is documented in the report [D3 Documentation of Standards chosen.pdf]
        which is a deliverable of the CINEA project [CINEA/CD(2022)5010/PP/SI2.899121]:
           > Constructing an open library containing a curated and
           > continuously growing digital catalogue of individual sound
           > signatures from the marine underwater soundscape in
           > shallow seas

        Parameters

        system_frequency : int
            Original sampling frequency from recorder in Hertz [Hz].
        hydrophone : str
            Description of the manufacturer and the used hydrophone type/model
            e.g. 'BrÃ¼ell&Kjaer 8106'.
        hydrophone_number : int
            Hydrophone serial number.
        sensitivity : np.array
            Hydrophone sensitivity in decibel reference 1 microPascal [dB re 1V/uPa]
        depth : float
            Position of the hydrophone, in meters below mean sea level [MSL].
        noise_floor : float
            Noise floor of the recorder + hydrophone system [dB re 1uPa]
        files : list
            List of soundsignature.Files associated to this System.
